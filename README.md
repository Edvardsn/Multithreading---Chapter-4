# Single- and multithreading assignment

## Instructions
1. Go to Main.java
2. Create new Single- or multithreaded server.
3. Run server
4. Send postman request on "http://localhost:8080"

## Observations
During this assignment we have observed how to take advantage of multithreading to accomplish tasks that have to be done concurrently. This is implemented by having our server implement the ability to run as a main thread and creating new threads for each new client. Giving us the ability to interact with multiple clients simultaneously.
